     <p>Global Village Paragraph: Global means Worldwide . By the term Global village we mean
        the world to be a single community linked by telecommunications and internet  connections .
        the term was first used by Marshall McLuhan.
        In his two books on media and communication he opined that telephone , tv and
        electronic media have brought all mankind close to one another .
        for example if we  watch the news of floods or earthquakes in a distant land on tv
        we feel that we are also living in there .we can see what is happening  at the same moment .
        we can share the same suffering with the people who are in the picture at the moment .
        McLuhan believed that electronic , communication would make the global village .
        when he first said about the idea  of global village , the internet was not invented .
        But now personal computers and the internet have made his idea more realistic than ever.
        now the entire globe is connected in a world wide web called ‘ The internet ‘</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Wage Erners</h2>
    <p>Although, the International Labour Organization has passed various acts and plotted various rules for the betterment of the worldwide labour, the labour in India still continues to be cheap.A wage earner is the one who earns wages (money) to support his/her daily needs to maintain or improve his/her lifestyle. What a labourer from US earns daily is 7 to 8 times more than what a wage earner in India earns. This is the reason due to which people from US or UK hire labour from India.</p>
